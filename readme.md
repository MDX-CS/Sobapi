This app provides api backend for the Middlesex' Sobmonitor app. It is a Laravel based project and the API authentication is handled via Laravel's Passport, which provides a fully functional Ouath 2 server. This means that anyone eligible to login to the Middlesex Uniersity system can create an app which would consume this API. See [Consuming the API](#consuming-the-api) for more information how to setup your Oauth client.
